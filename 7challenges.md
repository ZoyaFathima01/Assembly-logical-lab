During the completion of the lab, a few stumbling blocks bolstered my understanding of assembly programming and debugging. One of the primary difficulties was making sure the code was assembled and linked with debugging information included. Without the proper flags, the GDB would not display symbols or source lines, making it difficult to track variable changes. Also, a manual step-by-step operation was always necessary to understand the results that logical instructions such as XOR or TEST had on registers and memory, ensuring the expected behavior. Sometimes I had a hard time setting up watchpoints and breakpoints in GDB itself, as ordering the syntax right and pointing to the right memory addresses for variables became very important. These obstacles were beneficially useful in honing my technical skills but also stressed the significance of the proper use of tools in low-level debugging.
